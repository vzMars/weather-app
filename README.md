## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

The user can input a city and get the locationâ€™s current temperature, description of the weather, what the temperature feels like, and the humidity. The user can also switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The icon used for the temperature also changes depending on the condition of the weather.

## Optimizations:

As of right now, this is a front-end project and I am unable to truly hide this publicly available API key. I would like to go back and add a backend to hide my API key. I would also like to add a loading component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the data from the API comes back.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to get data from APIs by using Fetch. I also got to use async/await in this project which made it easier to read and write asynchronous code.
